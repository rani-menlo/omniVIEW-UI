# OmniVIEW Next Generation

OmniVIEW is an application designed to view and validate submissions in eCTD(The electronic common technical document (eCTD) is an interface and international specification for the pharmaceutical industry to agency transfer of regulatory information.) format with the XML backbone. Omnicia would like to build the next generation of the application by making it accessible anywhere.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run sonar` or `yarn sonar`

Sonar-qube sonar will be run on the app to analyze bugs, code coverage, code smell and etc.

### `npm run build:prod` or `yarn build:prod`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

We can build the application in different environments.
## `npm run build:staging` or `yarn build:staging`
## `npm run build:uat` or `yarn build:uat`
